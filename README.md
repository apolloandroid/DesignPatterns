# DesignPatterns
Simple realization of classic design patterns from Gang of Four.

The project is divided into three main modules in accordance with the classification of patterns from the Gang of Four:
- Behavioral 
- Creational
- Structural

Each pattern within these modules is in turn in a separate module.

The project is written in Java.

The theoretical basis of the patterns is taken from the site: https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns
